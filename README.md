Standard Markdown Tests

Tests and experiments with Standard Markdown

The new [Standard Markdown](http://standardmarkdown.com/) has a nifty standalone JavaScript library for parsing markdown into HTML. This repo will hold some tests I'll do with this fun tool.

The first file is a basic HTML page that takes the markdown in one div, hides it, and parses it into HTML for the other div. I could imagine using this as a poor man's Markdown presenter. I could add a simple JavaScript refresh timer to update the page every so often and reflect the updated content.
